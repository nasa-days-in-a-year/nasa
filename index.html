			<h2>How many days are in a year?</h2>
			<p>It takes the Earth approximately <b>365.25</b> days to go around the Sun. As a result, most areas on Earth consider 1 year to be 365 days, or 12 months, with a leap year every 4 years. However, due to the 23.5<span>&#176;</span> tilt of the Earth (see Figure 1 below), countries in the Northern Hemisphere experience <b>shorter years by about 23.5% on average</b>, since the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and experiences a slightly shorter orbit.</p>

			<p>For example, in Canada, one year is considered to be 8 months long (about 243 days), with a leap year every 3 years. In Russia, one year is approximately 9 months long.</p>

			<p>This effect, due to the Earth's tilt on its axis, also causes seasons in the Southern Hemisphere to be flipped. In locations like Australia, June-August is considered to be winter.</p>

			<p>Thus, the short answer to the question "How many days are in a year?" is, it varies!</p>
